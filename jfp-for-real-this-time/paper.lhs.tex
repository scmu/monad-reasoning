\begin{abstract}
  % Just as of programming languages, some effects are considered to be
  % more low-level than others.
  % Some of the effects are high level; and some are low level.

  Some of the effects are considered to be higher-level than others.
  %
  High-level effects provide expressive and succinct abstraction of
  programming concepts, while low-level effects allow more fine-grained
  control over program execution and resources.
  %
  It is desirable to write programs using the convenient abstraction
  offered by high-level effects, and at the same time still benefit
  from the optimisations enabled by low-level effects.
  %
  One solution is to translate high-level effects to low-level ones.

  This paper studies how high-level effects can be simulated in terms
  of low-level effects.
  %
  In particular, we focus at the two different interactions between
  state and nondeterminism, known as the local-state and global-state
  semantics.
  %
  We give translations from the high-level local-state semantics of to
  the low-level global-state semantics, and even further to only one
  low-level state effect.
  %
  We also show how to implement efficient backtracking in global-state
  semantics by restricting to restorable state updates.
  %
  Moreoever, we simulate the local-state semantics with two low-level
  stacks, a choicepoint stack and a trail stack, similar to the Warren
  Abstract Machine of Prolog.
  %
  We model state and nondeterminism as algebraic effects, interpret
  them and translate between them using effect handlers.
  %
  We prove the correctness of all our translations using program
  calculation and the fusion laws of effect handlers.

  %
  % We model state and nondeterminism with algebraic effects and
  % handlers, and simulate the high-level local-state semantics with a
  % single state effect via a sequence of translations.
  % %
  % We prove the correctness of translations by equational reasoning on
  % effect handlers.
  % %
  % %We distinguish between local-state and global-state semantics and
  % %transform the higher-level nondeterminism to state.
  % %
  % Moreover, we demonstrate possible optimisations such as efficient
  % backtracking and mutable states.
  % %
  % %We illustrate our simulations on the well-known n-queens example.
  % %prove all simulation functions correct using equational reasoning
  % %techniques.
